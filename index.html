        <p> Hello! My name is Santiago Padilla, and I am from Sucre, Bolivia. I am currently
            pursuing a double challenge: studying Telecommunications Engineering at Universidad
            San Francisco Xavier de Chuquisaca and Software Development at BYU-Idaho.
            I have a strong background in academics, having worked as an Assistant Professor
            for Calculus II and as a private tutor in Mathematics and Physics.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am passionate about technology and how it connects the world. My goal is to
            combine my knowledge in telecommunications with web development to create
            innovative digital solutions. In my free time, I love diving into books and
            watching sitcoms How I met your mother and Friends are some of my favorites!
            About my books La Casa de los Espiritus and The Monk are some of my favorites as well!
            I am so excited to be part of this course and to start my journey as a web developer.
